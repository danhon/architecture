# Development Practices
The Development Practices wiki contains development-related practices and standards that have been adopted by the project for the purpose of defining standard ways to accomplish our work. A practice, once defined and adopted, will be implemented by development teams for new work, or identified as technical debt when refactoring is required.

## Getting Started
This wiki is a place for documenting agreements and practices across the various development teams contributing code to CWDS projects. It is designed to be a living document that will evolve over time. The two pages below are where we recommend that you start your journey.
   * *Contribute:* Read the [Practices Style Guide](doc/practice-style-guide.md) to learn the _what_ and _how_ of new submissions
   * *Team Members:* A good place to start is the [Development Guide](dev-guide.md).
